# Why 
Stackblitz do not support uploading and hosting images for use inside their projects

## Option 1 (preferred)
1- Navigate to the `images` folder in this repository
2- Click the button `Upload Files` 
3- Drag and drop the image files into the drop section of the page
4- Click on the button `Commit changes`
5- Click on the desired image from the list
6- Right-click the image preview and select the action `Open image in new tab` 
7- Copy the image URL that should look like this:
  ```https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carballosa/stackblitz-images/master/images/<image-name>.png```
8- In the Stackblits project, paste that URL in the value of the src attribute of my img elements

## Option 2
1- Navigate to the `Issues` section of this repo
2- Click the button `New issue` 
3- Drag and drop the image files into the section `Write`
4- Copy the image URL that should look like this:
  ```https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12849860/58243805-ad9bc280-7d51-11e9-8182-68b45b48e38b.png```
5- Close the page `without` actually creating the issue
6- In the Stackblits project, paste that URL in the value of the src attribute of my img elements
